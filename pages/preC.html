                <h3>Native American History</h3>
                <p>The Pinelands has been occupied by humans for thousands of years! Before North America was discovered and
                colonized, the resource rich forests and wetlands of southern New Jersey were home to Native Americans.
                Their history can be broken into 3 main sections: The tribes, their colonization, and their legacy.</p>
                <h4>The Tribes</h4>
                <p>The Lenni-Lenape were the main tribe of the Pinelands region, and they often interacted with other tribes
                    such as the Powhatan Renape Nation, and the Ramapough Lenape Indian Nation who occupied the rest of the state.

                <h4>Colonization</h4>
                <p>When Europeans discovered and began to explore the Americas, Native Americans all over the continent faced
                    endless tragedies ranging from war and disease to general colonization and being forced from their homes.
                    The Lenni-Lenape were not the first to experience such tragedies, however they were the first to
                    experience a new wave of Native American colonization...reservations. The Brotherton Reservation was the
                    only Native American reservation in New Jersey and the first in the country. Although Brotherton was more
                    of a town soley for the Lenape, rather than a place where Native Americans were forced to go like most other
                    reservations, it was still a revolutionary concept that would be twisted and applied all over the country.</p>
                <h4>Legacy</h4>
                <p>Although the Brotherton reservation is no more, and there is little to no Native American population
                    in the Pinelands area, their legacy still lives on. Towns in the area are still big farming communites,
                    carrying on the innovative techniques started by the Lenape tribes, schools in the area have Native
                    American names and mascots in honor of the areas original founders, and there is even a town where the
                    original Brotherton Reservation once stood named Indian Mills.</p>
